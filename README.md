It run on on daisy seed by electrosmith.
To compile this code, you need a very outdated (and sligtlly custom) libdaisy, provided a a zip file

- twice more VCO waveforms
- twice more LFO waveforms
- twice more audio effect
- increase max cutoff of the main VCF
- add a A/D mode in to the A/R
- add a DJ mode to tha VCF2 filter (low/high on the same potentiometer)
- add a very slow mode for les lfo4,5 and 6 (up to more than 2.5h periode)
- when "LOAD" switch is press, the potentiometters are no more updated in order to allow cut transitions
- add an option to use CV switch to control keyboard octave
- The triangle VCO WF is more expressive
- lots of "fine tuning"
- fix a "no sound" bug
